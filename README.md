# 👋 Hi, I'm Jan-Philipp

I'm a **Cloud Engineer** who enjoys working in **Linux environments**, building scalable infrastructure on **AWS**, and using **Terraform** to manage it all as code.
I use **Python** to build and interact with APIs, especially in cloud and automation projects.

I have experience with:
- 🐧 Linux (CLI workflows, system administration)
- ☁️ AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, ECR, etc.)
- 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**
- 🐍 Python  Backend developing with **FastApi** and **Flask**
- 🐳 **Docker** and AWS **ECR** for containerized deployments
- 🗃️ Databases like **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite**

### 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub profile is where I:

- 🔨 Build small, focused projects to practice and showcase my skills
- 🔄 Fork and extend repos to experiment and learn from the community
- 📚 Document my journey in cloud engineering and automation

### 📂 Portfolio Projects

Some of the things you'll find in my repos:

- 🔒 IAM policy tools and security automation  
- ☁️ Terraform modules for deploying real-world AWS setups  
- 🧰 Python scripts for cost monitoring, resource tagging, and cleanup  
- 🧪 Experiments with containers, serverless, and event-driven architectures

> 💡 I believe in learning by building — and documenting along the way.
